## AWS Proton

This is the public roadmap for AWS Proton.

AWS Proton is an application delivery service, available at aws.amazon.com/proton


## Introduction

This is the public roadmap for AWS Proton. We want to use this roadmap to help our customers understand upcoming features that can be tried and give feedback on them.

We are interested in all kinds of feedback on our upcoming features. Please comment on whether or not each idea would help start using AWS Proton in your organization and standardize infrastructure.

This is an experimental public roadmap for a new service. We will continue to improve how we manage and organize this roadmap over time, based on input from customers that engage in it. If you have any suggestion on how to improve this process, please open an issue with your comments!

## FAQs
**Q: Why did you create this?**  
We want to make sure that we continue to build and deliver features that are important for our customers. We have a large roadmap and we want to rely on customer input to prioritize the features, as well as to design and deliver them in a way that will work

**Q: What is AWS Proton?**  
AWS Proton is an application delivery service. See aws.amazon.com/proton.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**  
Because job zero is security and operational stability, we can't provide specific target dates for features.

**Q: Will you build everything here?**  
We intend to investigate and priorotize all features here. We can't commit to delivering any feature or in any specific timeline.

**Q: Is this roadmap prioritized?**  
No. Any item here is being investigated or worked on, but we can't commit to a priority list at this point.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**  
Please open an issue!

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**  
Please open an issue!  You can read about how to contribute [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.

**Q: What does each of the column mean?**
* "Researching" means that we have received a request and are at some stage of finding out more about it - whether it is understanding more of the problem, deciding if this is something we can solve, looking for a chance to prioritize it, or defining the product experience for it. Note that items in "researching" could be there for a relatively long time as we make our way through analyzing them
* "Working on it" means that we are in active development, and we have an internal release date for it (even though we can't publizice it). Some of these are small features that will get done soon, some of them are larger projects and will ake a while. This column also includes features in the technical design phase
* "Just shipped" means that it was part of a recent release, somewhere in the last few months
* "Past releases" includes all elements of the public roadmap that shipped beyond 1-2 months ago
